I assume you are on `Windows`, but the software should run without issues on `Linux` as well. Please:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. Open `Windows Powershell` (or `Windows Terminal` or similar) and type:

```powershell
PS C:\> mkdir nwshared
PS C:\> cd .\nwshared\
PS C:\nwshared> git clone https://github.com/numbworks/nwshared.git
```

3. Open `src/nwshared.py` with `Visual Studio Code` or other code editor;
